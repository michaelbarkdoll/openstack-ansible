# OpenStack-Ansible

OpenStack-Ansible is an official OpenStack project which aims to deploy production environments from source in a way that makes it scalable while also being simple to operate, upgrade, and grow.

For an overview of the mission, repositories and related Wiki home page, please see the formal Home Page for the project (http://governance.openstack.org/reference/projects/openstackansible.html).

For those looking to test OpenStack-Ansible using an All-In-One (AIO) build, please see the Quick Start guide (http://docs.openstack.org/developer/openstack-ansible/developer-docs/quickstart-aio.html).

For more detailed Installation and Operator documentation, please see the Deployment Guide :
#### (https://docs.openstack.org/project-deploy-guide/openstack-ansible).

If you have some questions, or would like some assistance with achieving your goals, then please feel free to reach out to us on the OpenStack Mailing Lists (particularly openstack-operators or openstack-dev) or on IRC in #openstack-ansible on the freenode network.

This guide refers to the following types of hosts:

- Deployment host, which runs the Ansible playbooks
- Target hosts, where Ansible installs OpenStack services and infrastructure components

![Alt text](images/process.png?raw=true "Deployment Process")

Install one of the following supported operating systems on the **deployment hosts**:

- Ubuntu server 16.04 (Xenial Xerus) LTS 64-bit
- Centos 7 64-bit

Configure at least one network interface to access the Internet or suitable local repositories.

We also recommend setting your locale to en_US.UTF-8. Other locales might work, but they are not tested or supported.


## Prepare the Deployment Host

#### Ubuntu
````
$ apt-get update
$ apt-get dist-upgrade
$ apt-get install aptitude build-essential git ntp ntpdate \
  openssh-server python-dev sudo
````

#### Centos 
````
$ yum upgrade
$ yum install https://rdoproject.org/repos/openstack-ocata/rdo-release-ocata.rpm
$ yum install git ntp ntpdate openssh-server python-devel \
  sudo '@Development Tools'
````

### Configure the network

Ansible deployments fail if the deployment server canâ€™t use Secure Shell (SSH) to connect to the containers.

Configure the deployment host (where Ansible is executed) to be on the **same layer 2 network as the network designated for container management**. By default, this is the **br-mgmt network**. This configuration reduces the rate of failure caused by connectivity issues.

Select an IP address from the following example range to assign to the deployment host:

Container management: 172.29.236.0/22 (VLAN 10)


### Install the source and dependencies for the deployment host.



````
# Clone the latest stable release of the OpenStack-Ansible Git repository in the /opt/openstack-ansible directory:
$ git clone -b 16.0.0.0b2 https://git.openstack.org/openstack/openstack-ansible \
  /opt/openstack-ansible
# Change to the /opt/openstack-ansible directory, and run the Ansible bootstrap script:

$ cd /opt/openstack-ansible
$ scripts/bootstrap-ansible.sh
````

### Configure SSH keys

Ansible uses SSH with public key authentication to connect the deployment host and target hosts. To reduce user interaction during Ansible operations, do not include passphrases with key pairs. However, if a passphrase is required, consider using the ssh-agent and ssh-add commands to temporarily store the passphrase before performing Ansible operations.
